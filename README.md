## Projects Included

### 1. Car Price Prediction Model

**Description:**  
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various car attributes such as year, mileage, brand, engine size, and more. The goal is to create a reliable regression model that can estimate the market price of cars.

**Key Features:**  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns  
- Feature engineering and selection  
- Multiple regression models comparison (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Model evaluation using metrics like RMSE and RÂ²  

**Technologies & Libraries:**  
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

### 2. Titanic Survival Prediction Model

**Description:**  
This classification project aims to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using passenger data such as age, sex, ticket class, and fare. This classic ML project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training techniques.

**Key Features:**  
- Handling missing data and outliers  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Feature importance analysis  
- Classification models used: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest  
- Model evaluation through accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix  

**Technologies & Libraries:**  
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
